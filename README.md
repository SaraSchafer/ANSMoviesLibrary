# Welcome to ANS Movie Library!

## Overview
Here at ANS Movie Library, it's our mission to create an experience that lets users interact more with their movie experience. 
Our website allows you to comment on and rate movies, which can help those looking for a film to find something worth watching. 

Our true goal is to be re-sold as a concept to Netflix or Disney to enhance the sociability of these platforms and grow their user bases. 
This means that audiences can leave personalized reviews with star ratings that the actors of these films can 
review and respond to, creating a better sense of engagement with their viewers. Then those who are unsure if they should watch a film or 
missing key details about the characters can dig deeper in comments sections where they can find further lore about the cinema or a list of 
reasons why others did not enjoy the movie either.
